## How to Set Up Cheat Database

(_Article under construction_)

It's recommended that you download the archive in the <a href="#downloads">Downloads</a> section. To install the cheat database, download the <a href="https://github.com/Robz8/TWLoader/releases/download/v6.6.2/TWLoader.7z">TWLoader</a> file browser here and copy the contents of the archive to your sd card. If you don't already have the tool, please download <a href="https://www.7-zip.org/">7-Zip</a> immediately. In the TTMenu folder on the sd card, rename `usrcheat.dat` to something along the lines of `usercheat.bak` or anything other than `usrcheat.dat`. Then copy the `usrcheat.dat` from the `yoes_usercheat-database_current.zip` archive to the TTMenu folder. The above list will tell you whether or not there are cheats available for your NDS roms and regions.
